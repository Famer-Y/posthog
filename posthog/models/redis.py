    """Modelling mutation operations that can be applied on Redis.

    The intention behind this model execute mutations on Redis and keep track of mutatione executed. These
    mutations may require the input from multiple PostHog engineers, which is why there is an approval workflow
    built into the model. Before a mutation can be approved, it requires approval by at least 'approval_threshold'
    unique engineers, whose usernames are recorded in 'approved_by'.

    A mutation is defined by the following:
    * The Redis key we are mutating.
    * The command (or operation) we are running to mutate the value (i.e. SET, ZADD, or DEL).
    * Optionally, a value used by the mutation (not all commands need a value, for example DEL takes no value).
    * Optionally, additional parameters for a particular command.

    A mutation also has a status, which transitions as follows:

    .. mermaid::
      stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> CREATED
        state is_approved <<choice>>
        CREATED --> is_approved
